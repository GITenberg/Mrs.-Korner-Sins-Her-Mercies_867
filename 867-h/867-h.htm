    <p>
      &ldquo;I do mean it,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Korner, &ldquo;I like a man to be a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you would not like Christopher&mdash;I mean Mr. Korner&mdash;to be
      that sort of man,&rdquo; suggested her bosom friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mean that I should like it if he did it often. But I should like
      to feel that he was able to be that sort of man.&mdash;Have you told your
      master that breakfast is ready?&rdquo; demanded Mrs. Korner of the domestic
      staff, entering at the moment with three boiled eggs and a teapot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yus, I've told 'im,&rdquo; replied the staff indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The domestic staff at Acacia Villa, Ravenscourt Park, lived in a state of
      indignation. It could be heard of mornings and evenings saying its prayers
      indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Said 'e'll be down the moment 'e's dressed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody wants him to come before,&rdquo; commented Mrs. Korner. &ldquo;Answered me
      that he was putting on his collar when I called up to him five minutes
      ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer yer the same thing now, if yer called up to 'im agen, I 'spect,&rdquo;
       was the opinion of the staff. &ldquo;Was on 'is 'ands and knees when I looked
      in, scooping round under the bed for 'is collar stud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Korner paused with the teapot in her hand. &ldquo;Was he talking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talkin'? Nobody there to talk to; I 'adn't got no time to stop and
      chatter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean to himself,&rdquo; explained Mrs. Korner. &ldquo;He&mdash;he wasn't swearing?&rdquo;
       There was a note of eagerness, almost of hope, in Mrs. Korner's voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Swearin'! 'E! Why, 'e don't know any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Mrs. Korner. &ldquo;That will do, Harriet; you may go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Korner put down the teapot with a bang. &ldquo;The very girl,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Korner bitterly, &ldquo;the very girl despises him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; suggested Miss Greene, &ldquo;he had been swearing and had finished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Korner was not to be comforted. &ldquo;Finished! Any other man would
      have been swearing all the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; suggested the kindly bosom friend, ever the one to plead the
      cause of the transgressor, &ldquo;perhaps he was swearing, and she did not hear
      him. You see, if he had his head well underneath the bed&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry I am late,&rdquo; said Mr. Korner, bursting cheerfully into the room. It
      was a point with Mr. Korner always to be cheerful in the morning. &ldquo;Greet
      the day with a smile and it will leave you with a blessing,&rdquo; was the motto
      Mrs. Korner, this day a married woman of six months and three weeks
      standing had heard her husband murmur before getting out of bed on
      precisely two hundred and two occasions. The Motto entered largely into
      the scheme of Mr. Korner's life. Written in fine copperplate upon cards
      all of the same size, a choice selection counselled him each morning from
      the rim of his shaving-glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you find it?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Korner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is most extraordinary,&rdquo; replied Mr. Korner, as he seated himself at
      the breakfast-table. &ldquo;I saw it go under the bed with my own eyes. Perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't ask me to look for it,&rdquo; interrupted Mrs. Korner. &ldquo;Crawling about on
      their hands and knees, knocking their heads against iron bedsteads, would
      be enough to make some people swear.&rdquo; The emphasis was on the &ldquo;some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not bad training for the character,&rdquo; hinted Mr. Korner,
      &ldquo;occasionally to force oneself to perform patiently tasks calculated&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you get tied up in one of those long sentences of yours, you will
      never get out in time to eat your breakfast,&rdquo; was the fear of Mrs. Korner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be sorry for anything to happen to it,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Korner,
      &ldquo;its intrinsic value may perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will look for it after breakfast,&rdquo; volunteered the amiable Miss Greene.
      &ldquo;I am good at finding things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can well believe it,&rdquo; the gallant Mr. Korner assured her, as with the
      handle of his spoon he peeled his egg. &ldquo;From such bright eyes as yours,
      few&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've only got ten minutes,&rdquo; his wife reminded him. &ldquo;Do get on with your
      breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like,&rdquo; said Mr. Korner, &ldquo;to finish a speech occasionally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never would,&rdquo; asserted Mrs. Korner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to try,&rdquo; sighed Mr. Korner, &ldquo;one of these days&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you sleep, dear? I forgot to ask you,&rdquo; questioned Mrs. Korner of
      the bosom friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am always restless in a strange bed the first night,&rdquo; explained Miss
      Greene. &ldquo;I daresay, too, I was a little excited.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could have wished,&rdquo; said Mr. Korner, &ldquo;it had been a better example of
      the delightful art of the dramatist. When one goes but seldom to the
      theatre&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One wants to enjoy oneself&rdquo; interrupted Mrs. Korner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really do not think,&rdquo; said the bosom friend, &ldquo;that I have ever laughed
      so much in all my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was amusing. I laughed myself,&rdquo; admitted Mr. Korner. &ldquo;At the same time
      I cannot help thinking that to treat drunkenness as a theme&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wasn't drunk,&rdquo; argued Mrs. Korner, &ldquo;he was just jovial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear!&rdquo; Mr. Korner corrected her, &ldquo;he simply couldn't stand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was much more amusing than some people who can,&rdquo; retorted Mrs. Korner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is possible, my dear Aimee,&rdquo; her husband pointed out to her, &ldquo;for a
      man to be amusing without being drunk; also for a man to be drunk without&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a man is all the better,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Korner, &ldquo;for letting himself
      go occasionally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, Christopher, would be all the better for letting yourself go&mdash;occasionally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; said Mr. Korner, as he passed his empty cup, &ldquo;you would not say
      things you do not mean. Anyone hearing you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there's one thing makes me more angry than another,&rdquo; said Mrs. Korner,
      &ldquo;it is being told I say things that I do not mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why say them then?&rdquo; suggested Mr. Korner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't. I do&mdash;I mean I do mean them,&rdquo; explained Mrs. Korner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can hardly mean, my dear,&rdquo; persisted her husband, &ldquo;that you really
      think I should be all the better for getting drunk&mdash;even
      occasionally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't say drunk; I said 'going it.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do 'go it' in moderation,&rdquo; pleaded Mr. Korner, &ldquo;'Moderation in all
      things,' that is my motto.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Korner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little of everything and nothing&mdash;&rdquo; this time Mr. Korner
      interrupted himself. &ldquo;I fear,&rdquo; said Mr. Korner, rising, &ldquo;we must postpone
      the further discussion of this interesting topic. If you would not mind
      stepping out with me into the passage, dear, there are one or two little
      matters connected with the house&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Host and hostess squeezed past the visitor and closed the door behind
      them. The visitor continued eating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do mean it,&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Korner, for the third time, reseating
      herself a minute later at the table. &ldquo;I would give anything&mdash;anything,&rdquo;
       reiterated the lady recklessly, &ldquo;to see Christopher more like the ordinary
      sort of man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he has always been the sort&mdash;the sort of man he is,&rdquo; her bosom
      friend reminded her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, during the engagement, of course, one expects a man to be perfect. I
      didn't think he was going to keep it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems to me,&rdquo; said Miss Greene, &ldquo;a dear, good fellow. You are one of
      those people who never know when they are well off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know he is a good fellow,&rdquo; agreed Mrs. Korner, &ldquo;and I am very fond of
      him. It is just because I am fond of him that I hate feeling ashamed of
      him. I want him to be a manly man, to do the things that other men do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do all the ordinary sort of men swear and get occasionally drunk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course they do,&rdquo; asserted Mrs. Korner, in a tone of authority. &ldquo;One
      does not want a man to be a milksop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever seen a drunken man?&rdquo; inquired the bosom friend, who was
      nibbling sugar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaps,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Korner, who was sucking marmalade off her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      By which Mrs. Korner meant that some half a dozen times in her life she
      had visited the play, choosing by preference the lighter form of British
      drama. The first time she witnessed the real thing, which happened just
      precisely a month later, long after the conversation here recorded had
      been forgotten by the parties most concerned, no one could have been more
      utterly astonished than was Mrs. Korner.
    </p>
    <p>
      How it came about Mr. Korner was never able to fully satisfy himself. Mr.
      Korner was not the type that serves the purpose of the temperance
      lecturer. His &ldquo;first glass&rdquo; he had drunk more years ago than he could
      recollect, and since had tasted the varied contents of many others. But
      never before had Mr. Korner exceeded, nor been tempted to exceed, the
      limits of his favourite virtue, moderation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had one bottle of claret between us,&rdquo; Mr. Korner would often recall to
      his mind, &ldquo;of which he drank the greater part. And then he brought out the
      little green flask. He said it was made from pears&mdash;that in Peru they
      kept it specially for Children's parties. Of course, that may have been
      his joke; but in any case I cannot see how just one glass&mdash;I wonder
      could I have taken more than one glass while he was talking.&rdquo; It was a
      point that worried Mr. Korner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;he&rdquo; who had talked, possibly, to such bad effect was a distant cousin
      of Mr. Korner's, one Bill Damon, chief mate of the steamship <i>La Fortuna</i>.
      Until their chance meeting that afternoon in Leadenhall Street, they had
      not seen each other since they were boys together. The <i>Fortuna</i> was
      leaving St. Katherine's Docks early the next morning bound for South
      America, and it might be years before they met again. As Mr. Damon pointed
      out, Fate, by thus throwing them into each other's arms, clearly intended
      they should have a cosy dinner together that very evening in the captain's
      cabin of the <i>Fortuna</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Korner, returning to the office, despatched to Ravenscourt Park an
      express letter, announcing the strange news that he might not be home that
      evening much before ten, and at half-past six, for the first time since
      his marriage, directed his steps away from home and Mrs. Korner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two friends talked of many things. And later on they spoke of
      sweethearts and of wives. Mate Damon's experiences had apparently been
      wide and varied. They talked&mdash;or, rather, the mate talked, and Mr.
      Korner listened&mdash;of the olive-tinted beauties of the Spanish Main, of
      the dark-eyed passionate creoles, of the blond Junos of the Californian
      valleys. The mate had theories concerning the care and management of
      women: theories that, if the mate's word could be relied upon, had stood
      the test of studied application. A new world opened out to Mr. Korner; a
      world where lovely women worshipped with doglike devotion men who, though
      loving them in return, knew how to be their masters. Mr. Korner, warmed
      gradually from cold disapproval to bubbling appreciation, sat entranced.
      Time alone set a limit to the recital of the mate's adventures. At eleven
      o'clock the cook reminded them that the captain and the pilot might be
      aboard at any moment. Mr. Korner, surprised at the lateness of the hour,
      took a long and tender farewell of his cousin, and found St. Katherine's
      Docks one of the most bewildering places out of which he had ever tried to
      escape. Under a lamp-post in the Minories, it suddenly occurred to Mr.
      Korner that he was an unappreciated man. Mrs. Korner never said and did
      the sort of things by means of which the beauties of the Southern Main
      endeavoured feebly to express their consuming passion for gentlemen
      superior in no way&mdash;as far as he could see&mdash;to Mr. Korner
      himself. Thinking over the sort of things Mrs. Korner did say and did do,
      tears sprung into Mr. Korner's eyes. Noticing that a policeman was eyeing
      him with curiosity, he dashed them aside and hurried on. Pacing the
      platform of the Mansion House Station, where it is always draughty, the
      thought of his wrongs returned to him with renewed force. Why was there no
      trace of doglike devotion about Mrs. Korner? The fault&mdash;so he
      bitterly told himself&mdash;the fault was his. &ldquo;A woman loves her master;
      it is her instinct,&rdquo; mused Mr. Korner to himself. &ldquo;Damme,&rdquo; thought Mr.
      Korner, &ldquo;I don't believe that half her time she knows I am her master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away,&rdquo; said Mr. Korner to a youth of pasty appearance who, with open
      mouth, had stopped immediately in front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm fond o' listening,&rdquo; explained the pasty youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's talking?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Korner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are,&rdquo; replied the pasty youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a long journey from the city to Ravenscourt Park, but the task of
      planning out the future life of Mrs. Korner and himself kept Mr. Korner
      wide awake and interested. When he got out of the train the thing chiefly
      troubling him was the three-quarters of a mile of muddy road stretching
      between him and his determination to make things clear to Mrs. Korner then
      and there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of Acacia Villa, suggesting that everybody was in bed and
      asleep, served to further irritate him. A dog-like wife would have been
      sitting up to see if there was anything he wanted. Mr. Korner, acting on
      the advice of his own brass plate, not only knocked but also rang. As the
      door did not immediately fly open, he continued to knock and ring. The
      window of the best bedroom on the first floor opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that you?&rdquo; said the voice of Mrs. Korner. There was, as it happened, a
      distinct suggestion of passion in Mrs. Korner's voice, but not of the
      passion Mr. Korner was wishful to inspire. It made him a little more angry
      than he was before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you talk to me with your head out of the window as if this were a
      gallanty show. You come down and open the door,&rdquo; commanded Mr. Korner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't you got your latchkey?&rdquo; demanded Mrs. Korner.
    </p>
    <p>
      For answer Mr. Korner attacked the door again. The window closed. The next
      moment but six or seven, the door was opened with such suddenness that Mr.
      Korner, still gripping the knocker, was borne inward in a flying attitude.
      Mrs. Korner had descended the stairs ready with a few remarks. She had not
      anticipated that Mr. Korner, usually slow of speech, could be even
      readier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's my supper?&rdquo; indignantly demanded Mr. Korner, still supported by
      the knocker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Korner, too astonished for words, simply stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's my supper?&rdquo; repeated Mr. Korner, by this time worked up into
      genuine astonishment that it was not ready for him. &ldquo;What's everybody
      mean, going off to bed, when the masterororous hasn't had his supper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is anything the matter, dear?&rdquo; was heard the voice of Miss Greene,
      speaking from the neighbourhood of the first landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, Christopher,&rdquo; pleaded Mrs. Korner, &ldquo;please come in, and let me
      shut the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Korner was the type of young lady fond of domineering with a not
      un-graceful hauteur over those accustomed to yield readily to her; it is a
      type that is easily frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wan' grilled kinneys-on-toast,&rdquo; explained Mr. Korner, exchanging the
      knocker for the hat-stand, and wishing the next moment that he had not.
      &ldquo;Don' let's 'avareytalk about it. Unnerstan'? I dowan' any talk about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth am I to do?&rdquo; whispered the terrified Mrs. Korner to her
      bosom friend, &ldquo;there isn't a kidney in the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should poach him a couple of eggs,&rdquo; suggested the helpful bosom friend;
      &ldquo;put plenty of Cayenne pepper on them. Very likely he won't remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Korner allowed himself to be persuaded into the dining-room, which was
      also the breakfast parlour and the library. The two ladies, joined by the
      hastily clad staff, whose chronic indignation seemed to have vanished in
      face of the first excuse for it that Acacia Villa had afforded her, made
      haste to light the kitchen fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should never have believed it,&rdquo; whispered the white-faced Mrs. Korner,
      &ldquo;never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Makes yer know there's a man about the 'ouse, don't it?&rdquo; chirped the
      delighted staff. Mrs. Korner, for answer, boxed the girl's ears; it
      relieved her feelings to a slight extent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The staff retained its equanimity, but the operations of Mrs. Korner and
      her bosom friend were retarded rather than assisted by the voice of Mr.
      Korner, heard every quarter of a minute, roaring out fresh directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare not go in alone,&rdquo; said Mrs. Korner, when all things were in order
      on the tray. So the bosom friend followed her, and the staff brought up
      the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's this?&rdquo; frowned Mr. Korner. &ldquo;I told you chops.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm so sorry, dear,&rdquo; faltered Mrs. Korner, &ldquo;but there weren't any in the
      house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a perfectly organizedouse, such as for the future I meanterave,&rdquo;
       continued Mr. Korner, helping himself to beer, &ldquo;there should always be
      chopanteak. Unnerstanme? chopanteak!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll try and remember, dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Korner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pearsterme,&rdquo; said Mr. Korner, between mouthfuls, &ldquo;you're norrer sort of
      housekeeper I want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll try to be, dear,&rdquo; pleaded Mrs. Korner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's your books?&rdquo; Mr. Korner suddenly demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My books?&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Korner, in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Korner struck the corner of the table with his fist, which made most
      things in the room, including Mrs. Korner, jump.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you defy me, my girl,&rdquo; said Mr. Korner. &ldquo;You know whatermean, your
      housekeepin' books.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They happened to be in the drawer of the chiffonier. Mrs. Korner produced
      them, and passed them to her husband with a trembling hand. Mr. Korner,
      opening one by hazard, bent over it with knitted brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pearsterme, my girl, you can't add,&rdquo; said Mr. Korner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I was always considered rather good at arithmetic, as a girl,&rdquo;
       stammered Mrs. Korner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you mayabeen as a girl, and what&mdash;twenner-seven and nine?&rdquo;
       fiercely questioned Mr. Korner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty-eight&mdash;seven,&rdquo; commenced to blunder the terrified Mrs.
      Korner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know your nine tables or don't you?&rdquo; thundered Mr. Korner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I used to,&rdquo; sobbed Mrs. Korner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say it,&rdquo; commanded Mr. Korner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nine times one are nine,&rdquo; sobbed the poor little woman, &ldquo;nine times two&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goron,&rdquo; said Mr. Korner sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went on steadily, in a low monotone, broken by stifled sobs. The
      dreary rhythm of the repetition may possibly have assisted. As she
      mentioned fearfully that nine times eleven were ninety-nine, Miss Greene
      pointed stealthily toward the table. Mrs. Korner, glancing up fearfully,
      saw that the eyes of her lord and master were closed; heard the rising
      snore that issued from his head, resting between the empty beer-jug and
      the cruet stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will be all right,&rdquo; counselled Miss Greene. &ldquo;You go to bed and lock
      yourself in. Harriet and I will see to his breakfast in the morning. It
      will be just as well for you to be out of the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Mrs. Korner, only too thankful for some one to tell her what to do,
      obeyed in all things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward seven o'clock the sunlight streaming into the room caused Mr.
      Korner first to blink, then yawn, then open half an eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Greet the day with a smile,&rdquo; murmured Mr. Korner, sleepily, &ldquo;and it will&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Korner sat up suddenly and looked about him. This was not bed. The
      fragments of a jug and glass lay scattered round his feet. To the
      tablecloth an overturned cruet-stand mingled with egg gave colour. A
      tingling sensation about his head called for investigation. Mr. Korner was
      forced to the conclusion that somebody had been trying to make a salad of
      him&mdash;somebody with an exceptionally heavy hand for mustard. A sound
      directed Mr. Korner's attention to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The face of Miss Greene, portentously grave, was peeping through the jar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Korner rose. Miss Greene entered stealthily, and, closing the door,
      stood with her back against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you know what&mdash;what you've done?&rdquo; suggested Miss Greene.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke in a sepulchral tone; it chilled poor Mr. Korner to the bone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is beginning to come back to me, but not&mdash;not very clearly,&rdquo;
       admitted Mr. Korner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You came home drunk&mdash;very drunk,&rdquo; Miss Greene informed him, &ldquo;at two
      o'clock in the morning. The noise you made must have awakened half the
      street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A groan escaped from his parched lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You insisted upon Aimee cooking you a hot supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I insisted!&rdquo; Mr. Korner glanced down upon the table. &ldquo;And&mdash;and she
      did it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were very violent,&rdquo; explained Miss Greene; &ldquo;we were terrified at you,
      all three of us.&rdquo; Regarding the pathetic object in front of her, Miss
      Greene found it difficult to recollect that a few hours before she really
      had been frightened of it. Sense of duty alone restrained her present
      inclination to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While you sat there, eating your supper,&rdquo; continued Miss Greene
      remorselessly, &ldquo;you made her bring you her books.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Korner had passed the stage when anything could astonish him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lectured her about her housekeeping.&rdquo; There was a twinkle in the eye
      of Mrs. Korner's bosom friend. But lightning could have flashed before Mr.
      Korner's eyes without his noticing it just then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told her that she could not add, and you made her say her tables.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I made her&mdash;&rdquo; Mr. Korner spoke in the emotionless tones of one
      merely desiring information. &ldquo;I made Aimee say her tables?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her nine times,&rdquo; nodded Miss Greene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Korner sat down upon his chair and stared with stony eyes into the
      future.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's to be done?&rdquo; said Mr. Korner, &ldquo;she'll never forgive me; I know
      her. You are not chaffing me?&rdquo; he cried with a momentary gleam of hope. &ldquo;I
      really did it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You sat in that very chair where you are sitting now and ate poached
      eggs, while she stood opposite to you and said her nine times table. At
      the end of it, seeing you had gone to sleep yourself, I persuaded her to
      go to bed. It was three o'clock, and we thought you would not mind.&rdquo; Miss
      Greene drew up a chair, and, with her elbows on the table, looked across
      at Mr. Korner. Decidedly there was a twinkle in the eyes of Mrs. Korner's
      bosom friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll never do it again,&rdquo; suggested Miss Greene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think it possible,&rdquo; cried Mr. Korner, &ldquo;that she may forgive me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't,&rdquo; replied Miss Greene. At which Mr. Korner's face fell back
      to zero. &ldquo;I think the best way out will be for you to forgive her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The idea did not even amuse him. Miss Greene glanced round to satisfy
      herself that the door was still closed, and listened a moment to assure
      herself of the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you remember,&rdquo; Miss Greene took the extra precaution to whisper it,
      &ldquo;the talk we had at breakfast-time the first morning of my visit, when
      Aimee said you would be all the better for 'going it' occasionally?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, slowly it came back to Mr. Korner. But she only said &ldquo;going it,&rdquo; Mr.
      Korner recollected to his dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you've been 'going it,'&rdquo; persisted Miss Greene. &ldquo;Besides, she did
      not mean 'going it.' She meant the real thing, only she did not like to
      say the word. We talked about it after you had gone. She said she would
      give anything to see you more like the ordinary man. And that is her idea
      of the ordinary man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Korner's sluggishness of comprehension irritated Miss Greene. She
      leaned across the table and shook him. &ldquo;Don't you understand? You have
      done it on purpose to teach her a lesson. It is she who has got to ask you
      to forgive her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, if you manage it properly, it will be the best day's work you
      have ever done. Get out of the house before she wakes. I shall say nothing
      to her. Indeed, I shall not have the time; I must catch the ten o'clock
      from Paddington. When you come home this evening, you talk first; that's
      what you've got to do.&rdquo; And Mr. Korner, in his excitement, kissed the
      bosom friend before he knew what he had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Korner sat waiting for her husband that evening in the drawing-room.
      She was dressed as for a journey, and about the corners of her mouth were
      lines familiar to Christopher, the sight of which sent his heart into his
      boots. Fortunately, he recovered himself in time to greet her with a
      smile. It was not the smile he had been rehearsing half the day, but that
      it was a smile of any sort astonished the words away from Mrs. Korner's
      lips, and gave him the inestimable advantage of first speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Korner cheerily, &ldquo;and how did you like it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the moment Mrs. Korner feared her husband's new complaint had already
      reached the chronic stage, but his still smiling face reassured her&mdash;to
      that extent at all events.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When would you like me to 'go it' again? Oh, come,&rdquo; continued Mr. Korner
      in response to his wife's bewilderment, &ldquo;you surely have not forgotten the
      talk we had at breakfast-time&mdash;the first morning of Mildred's visit.
      You hinted how much more attractive I should be for occasionally 'letting
      myself go!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Korner, watching intently, perceived that upon Mrs. Korner
      recollection was slowly forcing itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was unable to oblige you before,&rdquo; explained Mr. Korner, &ldquo;having to keep
      my head clear for business, and not knowing what the effect upon one might
      be. Yesterday I did my best, and I hope you are pleased with me. Though,
      if you could see your way to being content&mdash;just for the present and
      until I get more used to it&mdash;with a similar performance not oftener
      than once a fortnight, say, I should be grateful,&rdquo; added Mr. Korner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;&rdquo; said Mrs. Korner, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean, my dear,&rdquo; said Mr. Korner, &ldquo;that almost from the day of our
      marriage you have made it clear that you regard me as a milksop. You have
      got your notion of men from silly books and sillier plays, and your
      trouble is that I am not like them. Well, I've shown you that, if you
      insist upon it, I can be like them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you weren't,&rdquo; argued Mrs. Korner, &ldquo;not a bit like them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did my best,&rdquo; repeated Mr. Korner; &ldquo;we are not all made alike. That was
      <i>my</i> drunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't say 'drunk.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you meant it,&rdquo; interrupted Mr. Korner. &ldquo;We were talking about drunken
      men. The man in the play was drunk. You thought him amusing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was amusing,&rdquo; persisted Mrs. Korner, now in tears. &ldquo;I meant that sort
      of drunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His wife,&rdquo; Mr. Korner reminded her, &ldquo;didn't find him amusing. In the
      third act she was threatening to return home to her mother, which, if I
      may judge from finding you here with all your clothes on, is also the idea
      that has occurred to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&mdash;you were so awful,&rdquo; whimpered Mrs. Korner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I do?&rdquo; questioned Mr. Korner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You came hammering at the door&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I remember that. I wanted my supper, and you poached me a
      couple of eggs. What happened after that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The recollection of that crowning indignity lent to her voice the true
      note of tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You made me say my tables&mdash;my nine times!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Korner looked at Mrs. Korner, and Mrs. Korner looked at Mr. Korner,
      and for a while there was silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you&mdash;were you really a little bit on,&rdquo; faltered Mrs. Korner,
      &ldquo;or only pretending?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; confessed Mr. Korner. &ldquo;For the first time in my life. If you are
      content, for the last time also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; said Mrs. Korner, &ldquo;I have been very silly. Please forgive
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
